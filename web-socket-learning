   HTTP(1.0) - 1995    
   
   
             For Each HttpRequest it create connection and send a response -> <- and close
             We cannot do web-socket on HTTP(1.0)
             
  HTTP(1.1)  - Super-Hero
         
               Only one HttpRequest it created connection and multiple-request send a multiple-response and finally close
               With the help of HTTP(1.1) Websocket is working

                                                              web-socket
   Web-Socket - Binary Protocol
   
             It is used to get response without request from the client - whatsapp, user is typingg.....

            Polling - create lot of new Http-request connection
                    - send lot of empty response
            
            Long-Polling - only one Http request connection for perticular time-period
                         - After the Time-out client have to create new request connection
            
            Web-socket   - Client create Web-socket connection with the help of web-socket hand-shake
                         - step 1: Client send a request for web-socket connection 
                         - step 2: Servet send a reponse in header for web-socket connection
                         - step 3:
