kafka - message distributing system
      - It is like a file system but it not a file system
      - It is used to store data and read data
      
Producer - Who pusing data into the kafka 

Consumer - who read the data from the kafka

Topic - data are store in Topic inside kafka

Partition - It happen inside the topic, It seperate(Distribute) the data and store it in partition(round robin type) because of this 
RoundRobin - let consider producer producing 1million data. you have 4 partition. Data is store in first 2.5Lakhs data in first partition 
                                                                                                  second 2.5Lakhs data in second partition
                                                                                                  third  2.5Lakhs data in third partition
                                                                                                  fourth 2.5Lakhs data in fourth partition 
Advantage of Partition:
                      - as a consumer reading the data from the topic fastly
                      - we can read the data parallelism(parallel) 
Broker - It just node(System), it has hardrive and ram 

Zookeeper - It is controller used to maintain topic during the transaction if it failed zookeeper offset it and continue where it failed      






steps
   
   1. create springBoot application 
       dependency Required:
                    1. spring kafka
                    2. spring web - to create Rest Controller
