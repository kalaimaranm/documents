                                                            Open-API
                                                            
            OAS(Open API Specification) - standard for Restful APIs 
                                        - Allow to access the specification without  access to source code
                                        - why? if you  have standardization like documentation user can build api with other language 
                                        
 How?
       - There  are 2 main ways to create open api specification
       ONE
       1. use swagger editor to build JSON/Yaml file
       2. use swagger code generator to create boiler plate code with your preffered language
       
       TWO
       1. download open api library to java project and use swagger annotation in project and build api
