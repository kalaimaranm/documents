      1. Implementation of HLD like how to write code 
      2. How to implement in software 
      3. How to design schema         
      
      
      
      use a noun to design a class
      
      
      dont draw class diagram for all the classes. 
      Draw only for Entity or noun
      
      
      Gather Requirement
      
      
      Multipayment - split bill  -> using paybalace+pay later+ bank acount
      Clarify Reuirement
      Dont Assume your self
      
      
      
      
      business logic - loan app -> checking the score
      retry payment with same transaction id(which is already failed) but with another card or UPI or B.A
      
      
      
      stater design pattern - eg: google map going to destination with different way
      
      Time series data - go for cassandra
      kafka - messaging queues
