                                                                  Docker
                                                                  
                                                                  
                                                                  
         All developer work in same environment 
         eg: Dependecy
             Replica of schema      
             
             
             
             Allows us to create container
             
             
             
        why Docker?
           clone the code from git in local machine then need to download the dependency to run the application in local machine.               
           moving parts (dependency) - like frontend dependency,backend dependency,schema	
           
           
           docker size is small compared to VM
           so, we can have large number of docker 	
           Kernal? - os is tracked by kernal        OS -> Kernel -> Hardware(Machine)
           
           
                                                         VM - Virtual Machine
                                                         
                  Infrastructure - Real Machine 
                  Hyperviser     - communicate between OS(Host Machine) and VM 
                  Each VM are isolated with each other
