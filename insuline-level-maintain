         glucose?
         
         insuline?
         
         carbohydrate? 


          Avoid eating late night food
          Having  12 - 16 hours fasting is good way giving rest and recover insuline
          Avoid having more sugar, packaged food
          Avoid having more carbohydrade(rice) food which contains more carbs->glucose glucose need insuline to process so, here need more insuline to digest
          If not good quanlity of insuline it take more and more insuline to process the glucose
          At point of time no production of insuline here the glucose are converted into fat and store in body (cause heart attack,sugar,strokes)
          Decrease Salt,stress
